            <h3 class="section-title-panel">"You Do Play Piano, Right?"</h3>
            <p>My first contract on the Pacific Sun had ended. I was home for a month, waiting to hear if P&O would bring me back. During my last week at sea, I'd gotten word that they wanted me - but nobody said which ship, or what I'd be doing.</p>
            <p>Then the phone rang.</p>
            <p>It was my agent. P&O wanted me back in four weeks for dry dock in Singapore. A "new" addition to the fleet - the Pacific Jewel. But there was a catch.</p>
            <p>They didn't want me as a guitarist this time. They wanted me in the newly revamped lounge called "The Orient Bar." At the piano.</p>
            <blockquote class="story-quote">"You do play piano, right?"<cite>- My Agent</cite></blockquote>
            <p>Well, yeah. Kind of.</p>
            <p>I had worked a piano bar back in 1984 when I was 18 years old. I didn't last longer than one summer. I play by ear - I knew I could accompany myself through all the Billy Joel and Elton John songs I would ever need.</p>
            <p>But was I a pianist? Not really. Not yet.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="story-section-panel">
            <span class="section-tag-panel">Singapore</span>
            <h3 class="section-title-panel">The Construction Zone</h3>
            <p>I boarded the Pacific Jewel in Singapore with about a month left of dry dock. The ship was a construction zone.</p>
            <img src="[CLOUDINARY_URL_DRYDOCK]" class="story-image" data-caption="Pacific Jewel in dry dock, Singapore. Workers on bicycles, scaffolding everywhere." alt="Pacific Jewel in dry dock">
            <p class="photo-caption-inline">Pacific Jewel in dry dock. Workers on bicycles passing by the massive hull.</p>
            <p>Contractors everywhere. People yelling and shouting in languages I didn't recognize. Lines a mile long in the cafeteria with project managers, construction workers, welders. We ate with them. Partied with them. Sweated through the hot, sticky Singapore November. Tripped over them.</p>
            <p>The musicians became close immediately. We had a few chores during the day - nothing too bad - but we got away as often as we could. I became very familiar with the Singapore MRT and the malls.</p>
            <blockquote class="story-quote">Malls meant only two things: food and wifi.</blockquote>
            <p>But there was a huge sense of underlying worry. The days were long. We walked for miles and miles every day around the city, finding cool things to do and places to just hang.</p>

            <span class="section-tag-panel">The Preparation</span>
            <h3 class="section-title-panel">Pounding the Keys</h3>
            <p>I started working in the Orient Bar until very late at night while the place was still a mess. All I needed was the piano.</p>
            <img src="[CLOUDINARY_URL_ORIENT_BAR]" class="story-image" data-caption="The Orient Bar. Elegant, intimidating, and about to become my proving ground." alt="The Orient Bar">
            <p class="photo-caption-inline">The Orient Bar. The room that terrified me.</p>
            <p>I had well over a hundred songs on my list. But I found I was falling back on only 30 of them. Those things I needed to correct before I would be ready for this.</p>
            <p>There were two other piano players in our group - Ashley and Alexander. Ashley was our band master. Alex was a child prodigy with a style similar to Liberace. Both were incredibly supportive because I was nervous as hell.</p>
            <p>The first time I saw that room - the elegant Orient Bar with its beautiful baby grand piano - my fear didn't go away. It grew. But I was with the Food & Beverage Manager who was showing me around. I couldn't show it.</p>
            <p>It may have only been my second contract at sea, but I had learned the importance of chain of command months ago.</p>

            <h3 class="section-title-panel">Oh Holy Shit</h3>
            <p>The Jewel was doing longer cruises than the Sun. Sometimes we were going to be out for 18 days on this ship.</p>
            <p>This was the inaugural cruise.</p>
            <p>There would be dignitaries on board.</p>
            <p>The governor.</p>
            <blockquote class="story-quote">Oh holy shit.</blockquote>
            <p>Yeah. I was nervous. Would you be nervous?</p>

            <p class="photo-caption-inline">I felt like a movie star. I was nervous as hell.</p>
            <p>The inaugural party was that night. Pink Hummer limos. Crowds everywhere. Fireworks over Darling Harbour.</p>

            <h3 class="section-title-panel">The Opera House at Night</h3>
            <p>We pulled away from the dock. The Opera House slid past, lit up against the night sky.</p>

            <p>Somewhere in that harbor, the guitarist I used to be stayed behind.</p>

            <p>I don't remember the first night at that piano. I've blocked most of it out.</p>
            <p>But I remember the second night. And the third. And somewhere around the fifth or sixth night, I realized something:</p>
            <blockquote class="story-quote">I wasn't drowning. I was swimming.</blockquote>
            <p>The ship had been transformed in Singapore. Rebuilt from the hull up.</p>
            <p>So had I.</p>
