                <p>My mom would tell you the singing came before the talking.</p>
                <p>Finding me as a kid was easy - just listen. The sound of drums, clarinet, guitar, or singing would lead you right to me. My mom, my grandma, my brother and sister - anyone who would listen became an audience. My great-grandma Gillette would hoist me up onto the doghouse where the Star Spangled Banner would ring out, the apples on the surrounding trees standing in as my crowd.</p>
                <p>Made-up songs. Harmonies with the radio. Constant daydreaming that got me into a lot of trouble.</p>
                <p>And the dreams. Fever dreams that came back over and over - a tin soldier swept through the gutters in a paper boat, drifting toward a walled city. I'd read the story so many times the pictures had burned themselves in. Sometimes I was the soldier. Sometimes I watched from above. I never knew where that city was.</p>
                <p>At age 7, when other kids were playing with Legos, my dad's Jazzmaster guitar became my new obsession.</p>

                <p>When music wasn't calling, the woods were. Hours spent walking the train tracks behind our house, so lost in thought that darkness would fall before the walk home. "Where have you been?" my exasperated mother would ask. Just wanted to see how far I could get before nightfall.</p>
                <p>Getting much further than the outskirts of that little town would have to wait a few years.</p>

                <p>1989 brought a band called Touched. We were hungry, and we were good. Through the early '90s we played high-end nightclubs and hotels, plus a few very questionable dive bars where certain death felt narrowly escaped more than once. The east coast was our circuit - Maine to Florida.</p>

                <h3 class="section-title-panel">Fourteen Years</h3>
                <p>A few years in, the bills started piling up. A steady paycheck meant a day job. Customer service. Nothing glamorous, but it paid the rent.</p>
                <p>The thing is - the music never stopped. Touched was still gigging on nights and weekends, still playing around Toledo well into the 2000s. Music just... became the side hustle.</p>
                <p>At first, the day job felt like a reasonable compromise. Stay home, pay the bills, play music when possible. But one year became five. Five became ten. Life shrunk to the size of a cubicle - phone ringing constantly, inbox stacked two feet high and growing. Three bosses on one floor. Plus the guy in the cubicle out front who wasn't a boss but hadn't gotten the memo.</p>
                <p>After almost fourteen years of this, a hard realization hit:</p>
                <blockquote class="story-quote">This was a waste of time.</blockquote>
                <p>The day job wasn't supporting the music career. It was slowly replacing it. Time to get out.</p>

                <h3 class="section-title-panel">Visualizing the Escape</h3>
                <p>In 2005, a few sets of guitar-vocal songs came together for my first solo gig in years. A good start, but there was still a ways to go. Escaping Toledo and making a real living playing music would require preparation.</p>
                <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/de5jbyhxx/image/upload/w_1200,q_80,f_auto/v1767710239/vlcsnap-2026-01-06-08h32m21s251_aqec7t.png" class="story-image" data-caption="2005. The first solo gig in years. The spark." alt="First solo gig">
                <p class="photo-caption-inline">2005. The first solo gig in years. The spark.</p>
                <p>The most important step was visualizing where music could lead again. A scrapbook of exotic places took shape - images of grand hotels, cruise ships, distant stages.</p>
                <p>Then one late night, a search for solo guitar gigs landed on a British talent website with an ad that read something like:</p>
                <blockquote class="story-quote">Vocalist/Guitarist wanted for employment opportunity on cruise ship.</blockquote>
                <p>The application was filled out that same night. A few days later, sitting at my desk at work, an email appeared:</p>
                <blockquote class="story-quote">"Hi Derrick, I watched your video and you really sound good! We might have an opportunity for you in the very near future. Is there a good time to talk?"</blockquote>
                <p>I left work early that day. The following month I was boarding a plane in Detroit. Destination: Auckland, NZ. Walking through that first door was the hardest thing ever. Everything got left behind - shoved into a storage space. Toledo faded in the rearview mirror on July 6th, 2009.</p>
                <blockquote class="story-quote final-quote">The lock fell away from Door #1 and opened to the possibility of everything that came after.</blockquote>

                <p>Two weeks. Two 7-day cruises. That was the industry standard - the unspoken trial period where the office watched to see if the new soloist would sink or swim. Past that 2-week window was a 14-day cruise to Darwin.</p>
                <p>Making it past that window meant the home office would turn their attention to more pressing matters. You were left alone to succeed, fail, or burn out at your own pace.</p>
                <p>Crew members whispered about the 14-day cruise to Darwin like it was a mystical place. Everyone was excited about an overnight stay. But Darwin represented something else entirely.</p>
                <p>Staying on and making it to Darwin without being handed a plane ticket home meant at least a full 4-month contract. And who knows - maybe an invitation to do it again.</p>

                <p>On the first day aboard, during orientation, the staff captain told us straight:</p>
                <blockquote class="story-quote">
                    "Ship life will fulfill you, drain you, or wreck you emotionally. You can tell a lot about a person based on how they conduct themselves aboard a ship."
                    <cite>- Staff Captain, Pacific Sun</cite>
                </blockquote>
                <p>Sitting there, the question hung in the air: am I ready for this? Ready to become the best version of myself? Because that's what this was going to take.</p>
                <p>Those first weeks were a blur. Learning the sets, the venues, the politics of ship entertainment. Learning the rhythm of a life in motion. You wake up in one country. Perform in another. Sleep somewhere in between.</p>

                <p>There was humor and irony in every story told at sea. It just happened that way - so many people from such different places, bumping into each other's unfamiliar ways.</p>

                        <li><strong>Beer Can Regatta:</strong> Every year Darwin hosts a regatta where boats must be made entirely of beer cans. Very Darwin.</li>

                <p>At some point it occurred to me. As a kid I'd read Hans Christian Andersen's <em>The Steadfast Tin Soldier</em> so many times that the illustrations had seared themselves into my subconscious - a tiny soldier, swept through the gutters in a paper boat, drifting toward a walled city. The story gave me fever dreams for years. Sometimes I was the soldier in the boat. Sometimes I watched from somewhere above. Once the boat fell into a gutter and vanished, just like in the story.</p>
                <p>I was fascinated by the story but so saddened that the soldier kept dying. I always wanted him to make it to the castle walls and finish the journey.</p>
                <p>I'd forgotten all about it. But the memory rushed back to me in the walled city. When I passed through the walls of Dubrovnik, I didn't fail to see the irony of the moment.</p>
                <blockquote class="story-quote">The tin soldier had finally made it beyond the gates. Alive to see all the mystery and magic of the walled city of Dubrovnik.</blockquote>

                        <li><strong>Ancient Predators:</strong> Komodo dragons have existed for about 4 million years. They're the last surviving species of a group of large lizards that once roamed Indonesia and Australia.</li>
                        <li><strong>Deadly Bite:</strong> Their saliva contains over 50 strains of bacteria plus venom glands - prey that escapes will die within 24 hours from blood poisoning.</li>
                        <li><strong>Speed Demons:</strong> Despite their size, Komodo dragons can sprint at 13 mph (21 km/h) in short bursts - faster than most humans.</li>
                        <li><strong>Limited Range:</strong> They exist only on a few Indonesian islands - Komodo, Rinca, Flores, and Gili Motang. Nowhere else on Earth.</li>
                        <li><strong>UNESCO Protected:</strong> Komodo National Park was established in 1980 to protect the dragons and was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1991.</li>

                <p>I came to know Singapore pretty well in the month-long stay. I learned my way around the Singapore MRT, and I scouted out all of the free wifi spots in the city, from the internet cafes to the malls.</p>
                <blockquote class="story-quote">Malls meant two things: food and wifi.</blockquote>

                <p>That was the escape. But underneath it all, underneath the exploring and the jokes and the long walks through the city, there was worry.</p>
                <p>I wasn't ready.</p>

                <p>Every night during dry dock, I worked in the Orient Bar until late. I had over a hundred songs on my list.</p>
                <p>But when I sat down to play? I kept falling back on the same 30.</p>
                <p>That was a problem.</p>
                <p>There were two other pianists in our group. Ashley, our band master. And Alexander, a child prodigy type, pure Liberace energy. Both were incredibly supportive. They had to be.</p>
                <p>I was nervous as hell.</p>
                <p>After dry dock, we sailed back to Auckland and then on to Sydney for the inaugural voyage. I practiced the whole way. Every spare moment at that piano, trying to expand my repertoire from 30 songs to something respectable.</p>

                <p>It grew.</p>
                <p>But I was with the Food & Beverage Manager. I couldn't let it show.</p>
                <p>Only my second contract at sea. But I'd already learned the importance of chain of command.</p>

                <p>Unlike my first contract on the Pacific Sun, the P&O Pacific Jewel itinerary was built for longer runs. Sometimes 18 days before we would return to Sydney to pick up another ship full of passengers.</p>
                <p>That meant I was required to entertain the same groups of people for twice as long.</p>
                <p>And this first cruise wasn't just any cruise.</p>
                <p>This was the <em>inaugural</em> voyage.</p>
                <p>There would be dignitaries on board.</p>

                <p>I wasn't scheduled to play until the ship started pulling away from Darling Harbour.</p>
                <p>By then it was late. Guests were still in their cabins after their first afternoon on board, still finding their way around. The Orient Bar was on Deck 7, towards the back of the ship. Not everyone would find it right away.</p>
                <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/de5jbyhxx/image/upload/w_1200,q_80,f_auto/v1769037243/004-6_gfk1p1.jpg" class="story-image" data-caption="Me at the piano in the Orient Bar." alt="Derrick at the piano">
                <p class="photo-caption-inline">Me at the piano. The Orient Bar. Elegant. Intimidating. Mostly windows.</p>
                <p>A few people came in and sat down at first.</p>
                <p>I played. The sound of a baby grand piano in a mostly empty room that was mostly windows. It was jarring. Every note hung in the air. Every squeak of the foot pedals. Every plink of my fingers on the keys.</p>
                <p>Then, mid-ballad, what I thought was one of my most impassioned performances of the evening, a couple walked up and asked if I could take their photo.</p>
                <blockquote class="story-quote">Sure. Of course.</blockquote>
                <p>Things settled into a cozy routine after that. I adjusted to the sound of the room. To the quiet.</p>
                <p>And then suddenly, people started walking in from both sides of the bar. Fifty of them. Maybe more.</p>
                <p>The Orient Bar came alive.</p>

                <p>But that's when it hit me. There's a rhythm to certain things on a ship. A coordinated effort between all the elements of life at sea. The dining, the entertainment, the shore excursions, even the sea days. The entire crew works together to achieve that rhythm. And to keep it going through good and bad.</p>

                <p>They call it "Windy Wellington" and they're not exaggerating. The city sits on the Cook Strait, and the wind funnels through with startling force.</p>
                <p>Locals don't carry umbrellas—they'd just invert. Instead, they lean into it, literally, walking at angles that would look absurd anywhere else.</p>
                <p>But the wind keeps the air clean, the sky clear, and the city invigorated. Wellington earns its energy from the elements.</p>

                <p>And then there's Weta Workshop—where Peter Jackson built Middle-earth. The Lord of the Rings wasn't just filmed here; it was invented here. The creative energy stuck around.</p>
                <p>For a city of 215,000, Wellington has the cultural infrastructure of somewhere much larger.</p>

                <p>Tauranga itself has become a retirement destination for Kiwis seeking sun. After hiking the Mount and swimming in the bay, you understand why.</p>

                <p>The Pacific Pearl had just come out of a month-long refit in Singapore. All crew were onboard as we sailed her out of dry dock - a sweltering month of work with little to no air conditioning and plenty of alcohol for the musicians.</p>
                <p>I was about two years into my contracted life at sea by then. The ship was being transformed from Ocean Village into P&O Australia's newest vessel. New restaurants, new bars, new everything.</p>
                <p>Including a massive chandelier in the atrium.</p>

                <h3 class="section-title-panel">We Watched Them Hang It</h3>
                <p>Me and another crew member watched them install that chandelier. A huge iron and steel structure, several hundred pounds, suspended three stories above the atrium floor.</p>
                <p>They didn't do any load testing. Nothing. They were rushing to get the old girl ready for launch.</p>
                <p>We joked that it wasn't going to last an entire cruise.</p>
                <p>On the maiden voyage out of Sydney, just hours after a massive party in the atrium - all the musicians jamming, passengers running around everywhere, champagne flowing - it fell.</p>
                <p>Three stories. Middle of the night. Crashed into the café area below.</p>
                <p>An hour earlier, we'd all been standing right under it.</p>
                <p>P&O's official statement said "the reassuring thing was that there were no passengers or crew anywhere near the area when it happened." Yeah - because it was 3 AM.</p>

                <p>That was just the beginning.</p>
                <p>A bad storm hit on our first night out of Sydney. Then the captain made an announcement that would have been funny if it wasn't terrifying:</p>
                <p>We had somehow ended up sandwiched between two cyclones.</p>
                <p>The original itinerary - Isle of Pines, maybe Mystery Island - was scrapped. We were making an emergency overnight stop at Port Vila instead.</p>
                <p>The 2010-2011 South Pacific cyclone season was brutal. Cyclone Vania. Cyclone Yasi. Cyclone Atu. We were caught in the middle of all of it.</p>

                <p>The captain put the boat into the dock at Port Vila with enough force that it knocked me off my bed. I was changing my guitar strings at the time.</p>
                <p>When I stood up and got my bearings, I noticed two things:</p>
                <p>First, my floor had buckled upward.</p>
                <p>Second, there was a crack running all the way up my cabin wall. Through that crack, I could see what looked like the hull of the ship.</p>
                <p>For a few days after that, I was famous. The staff captain, head engineer - and it felt like all 700 crew onboard - wanted to peek inside my cabin. After a while I just left my door open for a few days.</p>
                <p>Then I was moved temporarily to a passenger cabin while they made "repairs."</p>
                <p>I never did go back to that cabin. But my good friend Daryl Stevenette did a contract a year later on the Pearl - and the floor was still buckled. The bathroom door didn't quite shut right.</p>
                <p>The staff captain looked at me and said: "You were lucky."</p>
                <p>I could have been crushed by a cruise ship.</p>

                <p>The Pacific Pearl's maiden voyage became legendary for all the wrong reasons:</p>
                <p>• Chandelier falls 3 stories (hours after party underneath)<br>
                • Caught between two cyclones<br>
                • Emergency diversion to Port Vila<br>
                • Hull damage during docking<br>
                • Medical evacuation near Great Barrier Island<br>
                • Non-flushing toilets<br>
                • No drinking water during the storm</p>
                <p>As crew, we were forbidden to talk about most of it. The chandelier incident especially.</p>
                <p>But the ship no longer exists. P&O Australia no longer exists. And this is my story to tell.</p>

                <p>Lifou was one of those places that felt like a secret. A tender port on the regular P&O rotation through the South Pacific - Nouméa, Isle of Pines, Port Vila, and here.</p>
                <p>On the far side of the island was a swimming and snorkeling spot with water so clear it barely looked real. The kind of place you'd see in a travel brochure and assume was photoshopped.</p>
                <p>But it was the church on the hill that kept drawing me back.</p>

                <p>Every time we called at Lifou, I'd make the climb up to this church. It became a ritual. The walk was hot and dusty, but there was something peaceful about that little building at the top of the hill.</p>
                <p>The Pacific run took us through places I'd only seen in documentaries. Turquoise water so clear you could count fish from the tender. Churches older than any building I'd ever entered. Islands where time moved differently.</p>

                <p>One day, walking up to the church, I noticed him. A spider - and not a small one - nestled in a wooden fence that separated someone's property from the road.</p>
                <p>He seemed almost like a pet. Just sitting there in his web, unbothered by the world passing by.</p>
                <p>After that, every time we visited Lifou, I'd look for him as I climbed up to the church. He became my little landmark. A familiar face - all eight eyes of it - on an island far from home.</p>
                <p>And then one visit, he was gone.</p>
                <p>I don't know what happened to him. Maybe he moved on. Maybe something got him. But I still looked for him every time after that, just in case.</p>

                <p>Portugal arrived in Goa in 1510 and didn't leave until 1961—making this the longest European colonial presence in Asia.</p>
                <p>The result is something unique: baroque churches next to Hindu temples. Vindaloo and sorpotel alongside fish curry. Catholic feast days celebrated with Indian fervor.</p>
                <p>Goa doesn't feel like India. It doesn't feel like Portugal either. It's its own thing entirely.</p>

                <p>Before we reached South Georgia, a penguin expert gave a series of talks aboard ship. He was brilliant - the kind of scientist who could make you care deeply about something you'd never thought twice about.</p>
                <p>One evening in the lounge, he showed us a map that tracked the history of commercial whaling. It started in the Northern Atlantic, then moved to the Pacific as those populations collapsed. When there was nothing left up north, the industry pushed south - all the way to these waters.</p>
                <blockquote class="story-quote">They hunted whale populations to near extinction in the north, then chased the survivors to the bottom of the world.</blockquote>
                <p>He hung out with us musicians in the lounge several nights after his talks. He'd request Dan Fogelberg and Cat Stevens songs while we talked about the wildlife we'd see. I wish I'd gotten a photo with him.</p>

                <p>I didn't plan to find Shackleton's grave. I was walking around the island, trying to process everything I'd seen, when I stumbled onto the small cemetery.</p>
                <p>And there he was. Ernest Henry Shackleton. Explorer. The man who led the most incredible survival story in history - 28 men stranded on the ice for over a year, every single one brought home alive.</p>
                <p>He died here in 1922, at the start of another expedition. His wife asked that he be buried on South Georgia, the island where he'd achieved his greatest triumph. Sailors who visit leave whisky at his grave and toast to "The Boss."</p>

                <p>South Georgia sits at the edge of everything. The edge of the map. The edge of human habitation. The edge of what we're capable of - both the worst and the best.</p>
                <p>We came here to see wildlife, and we saw it in abundance. But we also saw what happens when humans decide something is a resource to be extracted. And we saw what happens when we finally stop.</p>
                <p>The penguins don't know about the history. The seals don't care about the rusted machinery. They've simply moved back in. Maybe that's the only redemption available - not forgiveness, just the patient work of time and nature reclaiming what was taken.</p>

                        <li><strong>Border Dispute:</strong> The channel marks the border between Chile and Argentina. The two nations nearly went to war over islands here in 1978 before the Pope mediated a settlement.</li>
                        <li><strong>Glacier Alley:</strong> The nearby Avenue of the Glaciers features five tidewater glaciers descending from the Darwin Ice Field - named Italia, Holanda, Alemania, Francia, and España.</li>
                        <li><strong>Indigenous History:</strong> The Yaghan people navigated these waters for over 10,000 years, surviving the harsh climate as the world's southernmost human inhabitants.</li>

                        <li><strong>Meeting of the Waters:</strong> Near Manaus, the black Rio Negro meets the sandy Rio Solimões. They flow side by side without mixing for over 3 miles due to differences in temperature, speed, and density.</li>
                        <li><strong>Rubber Boom:</strong> In the late 1800s, Manaus was one of the wealthiest cities on Earth. The rubber barons sent their laundry to Europe and built an opera house in the jungle.</li>
                        <li><strong>Teatro Amazonas:</strong> Opened in 1896 with materials imported from Europe - Italian marble, Scottish steel, French tiles. The dome features 36,000 tiles in the colors of the Brazilian flag.</li>

                <p>I wandered deep into Copacabana and found a little cafeteria with servers - not quite a restaurant, but close enough. I ordered, ate, and went to pay.</p>
                <p>My credit card wouldn't work.</p>
                <p>No cash. No Portuguese. The guy at the register didn't speak English. Someone next to him started translating. I called my bank - they said it wasn't their fault. <em>Yada yada.</em></p>
                <p>Here's the thing: this must happen often at this particular place, because they had a thick metal gate across the doors. To keep people from running.</p>
                <p>After several frantic minutes of explaining, gesturing, phone calls, and what I can only describe as <em>international panic</em>... he punched my number in manually.</p>
                <p><strong>Bingo.</strong> I was free.</p>

                        <li><strong>Selarón Steps:</strong> Chilean artist Jorge Selarón began covering the steps in tiles in 1990 as a tribute to Brazil. By his death in 2013, the 215 steps featured over 2,000 tiles from 60+ countries. Artists and visitors still add tiles today.</li>
                        <li><strong>Copacabana Beach:</strong> This 2.5-mile crescent of sand sees over 2 million people on New Year's Eve for the world's largest beach party. The distinctive wave-pattern sidewalk was designed by Roberto Burle Marx in 1970.</li>
                        <li><strong>Favelas:</strong> Rio has over 1,000 favelas, home to roughly 1.5 million residents. Some date back to the 1890s when former soldiers had nowhere to live. Today they're vibrant communities with their own culture, music, and art scenes.</li>
                        <li><strong>Sugarloaf Cable Car:</strong> One of the world's oldest cable cars, running since 1912. The two-stage ride carries visitors 1,299 feet up Sugarloaf Mountain for panoramic views of the city and Guanabara Bay.</li>

                <p>Phuket taught me a lesson I'll never forget.</p>
                <p>The Cruise Director had given me the day off - a rare occurrence on an overnight. A walk through town. Looking for something to eat, maybe a drink.</p>

                <p>I found a bar with giant jungle animals painted on the walls. Seemed friendly enough. I sat down and started chatting with the bloke next to me - a "shoe salesman from Croatia," or so he said.</p>
                <p>A few minutes into our conversation, one of the girls from behind the bar got off work - or so she said - and sat down on my other side.</p>
                <p>Just friendly conversation. My radar was up, and I didn't sense anything was off.</p>
                <p>One beer. One shot.</p>
                <p>Then the woman asked if I was alone. Something finally clicked. I waved to a bunch of random people in the corner like I knew them.</p>
                <p>The next thing I remember, I'm stumbling toward the bathroom. Then nothing.</p>

                <p>I woke up slouched against a urinal. I couldn't stand. I couldn't think straight.</p>
                <p>Then I heard a voice: "Hey - that's Derrick!"</p>
                <p>A hand grabbed me. Pulled my arm over a shoulder. Got me out of there.</p>
                <p>Martin Neely. A fellow musician. A friend. I may have had a few more minutes before I was robbed - or worse - when he walked in and saw me.</p>
                <p>Here's the thing: I had walked around Phuket all day. Downtown, the beaches, everywhere. I hadn't run into a single crew member. Not one. And then, the one moment I really needed someone - there was Martin.</p>

                <p>There are two ways to arrive in Honolulu. Most people land at the airport, fight through baggage claim, and take a shuttle to their hotel.</p>
                <p>Arriving by ship is different. You wake up to Diamond Head emerging from morning mist. The high-rises of Waikiki catch the early light. The harbor sits right downtown, a short walk from everything.</p>

                <p>I won't pretend Honolulu is undiscovered. It's one of the most touristed places on Earth. The ABC stores repeat every block. The mai tais cost too much. "Aloha" is printed on everything.</p>
                <p>But the natural beauty doesn't care about commercialization. Diamond Head still dominates the skyline. The water is still impossibly blue. The trade winds still blow.</p>
                <p>Hawaii became a cliché because it earned it.</p>

                <p>These walls weren't decorative. They were built because pirates kept attacking.</p>
                <p>For centuries, Cartagena was where Spanish treasure ships gathered before crossing the Atlantic. That made it a target. Sir Francis Drake ransomed the city. The French sacked it repeatedly.</p>
                <p>So they built walls. Eleven kilometers of them. They still stand, and you can walk their entire length at sunset while the Caribbean burns orange.</p>

                <p>The fish market at Angelmó is reason enough to come. Stalls overflow with the strange bounty of cold southern waters—sea urchins, giant mussels, seaweed you've never seen before.</p>
                <p>Locals eat curanto—a traditional stew of shellfish, meat, and potatoes—at plastic tables while seabirds circle overhead.</p>
                <p>It's loud and crowded and smells like the sea. Perfect.</p>
