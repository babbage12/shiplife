                <p>My mom would tell you the singing came before the talking.</p>
                <p>Finding me as a kid was easy - just listen. The sound of drums, clarinet, guitar, or singing would lead you right to me. My mom, my grandma, my brother and sister - anyone who would listen became an audience. My great-grandma Gillette would hoist me up onto the doghouse where the Star Spangled Banner would ring out, the apples on the surrounding trees standing in as my crowd.</p>
                <p>Made-up songs. Harmonies with the radio. Constant daydreaming that got me into a lot of trouble.</p>
                <p>And the dreams. Fever dreams that came back over and over - a tin soldier swept through the gutters in a paper boat, drifting toward a walled city. I'd read the story so many times the pictures had burned themselves in. Sometimes I was the soldier. Sometimes I watched from above. I never knew where that city was.</p>
                <p>At age 7, when other kids were playing with Legos, my dad's Jazzmaster guitar became my new obsession.</p>

                <p>By thirteen, I had joined my first band. We called ourselves 5th Avenue, and we played anywhere that would have us - including the Stony Ridge Fair, right in the small town where we grew up.</p>

                <p>When music wasn't calling, the woods were. Hours spent walking the train tracks behind our house, so lost in thought that darkness would fall before the walk home. "Where have you been?" my exasperated mother would ask. Just wanted to see how far I could get before nightfall.</p>
                <p>Getting much further than the outskirts of that little town would have to wait a few years.</p>

                <p>1989 brought a band called Touched. We were hungry, and we were good. Through the early '90s we played high-end nightclubs and hotels, plus a few very questionable dive bars where certain death felt narrowly escaped more than once. The east coast was our circuit - Maine to Florida.</p>

                <h3 class="section-title-panel">Fourteen Years</h3>
                <p>A few years in, the bills started piling up. A steady paycheck meant a day job. Customer service. Nothing glamorous, but it paid the rent.</p>
                <p>The thing is - the music never stopped. Touched was still gigging on nights and weekends, still playing around Toledo well into the 2000s. Music just... became the side hustle.</p>
                <p>At first, the day job felt like a reasonable compromise. Stay home, pay the bills, play music when possible. But one year became five. Five became ten. Life shrunk to the size of a cubicle - phone ringing constantly, inbox stacked two feet high and growing. Three bosses on one floor. Plus the guy in the cubicle out front who wasn't a boss but hadn't gotten the memo.</p>
                <p>After almost fourteen years of this, a hard realization hit:</p>
                <blockquote class="story-quote">This was a waste of time.</blockquote>
                <p>The day job wasn't supporting the music career. It was slowly replacing it. Time to get out.</p>

                <h3 class="section-title-panel">Visualizing the Escape</h3>
                <p>In 2005, a few sets of guitar-vocal songs came together for my first solo gig in years. A good start, but there was still a ways to go. Escaping Toledo and making a real living playing music would require preparation.</p>
                <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/de5jbyhxx/image/upload/w_1200,q_80,f_auto/v1767710239/vlcsnap-2026-01-06-08h32m21s251_aqec7t.png" class="story-image" data-caption="2005. The first solo gig in years. The spark." alt="First solo gig">
                <p class="photo-caption-inline">2005. The first solo gig in years. The spark.</p>
                <p>The most important step was visualizing where music could lead again. A scrapbook of exotic places took shape - images of grand hotels, cruise ships, distant stages.</p>
                <p>Then one late night, a search for solo guitar gigs landed on a British talent website with an ad that read something like:</p>
                <blockquote class="story-quote">Vocalist/Guitarist wanted for employment opportunity on cruise ship.</blockquote>
                <p>The application was filled out that same night. A few days later, sitting at my desk at work, an email appeared:</p>
                <blockquote class="story-quote">"Hi Derrick, I watched your video and you really sound good! We might have an opportunity for you in the very near future. Is there a good time to talk?"</blockquote>
                <p>I left work early that day. The following month I was boarding a plane in Detroit. Destination: Auckland, NZ. Walking through that first door was the hardest thing ever. Everything got left behind - shoved into a storage space. Toledo faded in the rearview mirror on July 6th, 2009.</p>
                <blockquote class="story-quote final-quote">The lock fell away from Door #1 and opened to the possibility of everything that came after.</blockquote>

                <p>Two weeks. Two 7-day cruises. That was the industry standard - the unspoken trial period where the office watched to see if the new soloist would sink or swim. Past that 2-week window was a 14-day cruise to Darwin.</p>
                <p>Making it past that window meant the home office would turn their attention to more pressing matters. You were left alone to succeed, fail, or burn out at your own pace.</p>
                <p>Crew members whispered about the 14-day cruise to Darwin like it was a mystical place. Everyone was excited about an overnight stay. But Darwin represented something else entirely.</p>
                <p>Staying on and making it to Darwin without being handed a plane ticket home meant at least a full 4-month contract. And who knows - maybe an invitation to do it again.</p>
                <blockquote class="story-quote">Making it to Darwin meant making it anywhere.</blockquote>

                <p>Darwin marked the end of my probation. Five weeks into a four-month contract, we pulled into port and I realized something had shifted. The constant vigilance from management had eased. My name appeared in the daily entertainment schedule without revision.</p>

                </blockquote>
                <p>Sitting there, the question hung in the air: am I ready for this? Ready to become the best version of myself? Because that's what this was going to take.</p>
                <p>Those first weeks were a blur. Learning the sets, the venues, the politics of ship entertainment. Learning the rhythm of a life in motion. You wake up in one country. Perform in another. Sleep somewhere in between.</p>

                <p>At some point it occurred to me. As a kid I'd read Hans Christian Andersen's <em>The Steadfast Tin Soldier</em> so many times that the illustrations had seared themselves into my subconscious - a tiny soldier, swept through the gutters in a paper boat, drifting toward a walled city. The story gave me fever dreams for years. Sometimes I was the soldier in the boat. Sometimes I watched from somewhere above. Once the boat fell into a gutter and vanished, just like in the story.</p>
                <p>I was fascinated by the story but so saddened that the soldier kept dying. I always wanted him to make it to the castle walls and finish the journey.</p>
                <p>I'd forgotten all about the story and how real it seemed to me as a child, but when I passed through the outer gate into the walled city, I didn't fail to see the irony.</p>
                <blockquote class="story-quote">The tin soldier had finally made it beyond the gates. Alive to see all the mystery and magic of the walled city of Dubrovnik.</blockquote>

                <p>Komodo dragons are the largest living lizards on Earth - up to 10 feet long and 150 pounds of prehistoric muscle. They've been here for millions of years, unchanged.</p>
                <p>We walked through the park with rangers, keeping our distance. These things can run faster than you'd think, and their bite is loaded with bacteria. One chomp and you're done for.</p>

                        <li><strong>Ancient Predators:</strong> Komodo dragons have existed for about 4 million years. They're the last surviving species of a group of large lizards that once roamed Indonesia and Australia.</li>
                        <li><strong>Deadly Bite:</strong> Their saliva contains over 50 strains of bacteria plus venom glands - prey that escapes will die within 24 hours from blood poisoning.</li>
                        <li><strong>Speed Demons:</strong> Despite their size, Komodo dragons can sprint at 13 mph (21 km/h) in short bursts - faster than most humans.</li>
                        <li><strong>Limited Range:</strong> They exist only on a few Indonesian islands - Komodo, Rinca, Flores, and Gili Motang. Nowhere else on Earth.</li>
                        <li><strong>UNESCO Protected:</strong> Komodo National Park was established in 1980 to protect the dragons and was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1991.</li>

                        <li><strong>The Colosseum:</strong> Could hold 50,000-80,000 spectators. The wooden arena floor covered a complex underground network of tunnels and animal cages.</li>

                <p>That was the escape. But underneath it all, underneath the exploring and the jokes and the long walks through the city, there was worry.</p>
                <p>I wasn't ready.</p>

                <p>Every night during dry dock, I worked in the Orient Bar until late. I had over a hundred songs on my list.</p>
                <p>But when I sat down to play? I kept falling back on the same 30.</p>
                <p>That was a problem.</p>
                <p>There were two other pianists in our group. Ashley, our band master. And Alexander, a child prodigy type, pure Liberace energy. Both were incredibly supportive. They had to be.</p>
                <p>I was nervous as hell.</p>
                <p>After dry dock, we sailed back to Auckland and then on to Sydney for the inaugural voyage. I practiced the whole way. Every spare moment at that piano, trying to expand my repertoire from 30 songs to something respectable.</p>

                <p>It grew.</p>
                <p>But I was with the Food & Beverage Manager. I couldn't let it show.</p>
                <p>Only my second contract at sea. But I'd already learned the importance of chain of command.</p>

                <p>Unlike my first contract on the Pacific Sun, the P&O Pacific Jewel itinerary was built for longer runs. Sometimes 18 days before we would return to Sydney to pick up another ship full of passengers.</p>
                <p>That meant I was required to entertain the same groups of people for twice as long.</p>
                <p>And this first cruise wasn't just any cruise.</p>
                <p>This was the <em>inaugural</em> voyage.</p>
                <p>There would be dignitaries on board.</p>

                <p>I wasn't scheduled to play until the ship started pulling away from Darling Harbour.</p>
                <p>By then it was late. Guests were still in their cabins after their first afternoon on board, still finding their way around. The Orient Bar was on Deck 7, towards the back of the ship. Not everyone would find it right away.</p>
                <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/de5jbyhxx/image/upload/w_1200,q_80,f_auto/v1769037243/004-6_gfk1p1.jpg" class="story-image" data-caption="Me at the piano in the Orient Bar." alt="Derrick at the piano">
                <p class="photo-caption-inline">Me at the piano. The Orient Bar. Elegant. Intimidating. Mostly windows.</p>
                <p>A few people came in and sat down at first.</p>
                <p>I played. The sound of a baby grand piano in a mostly empty room that was mostly windows. It was jarring. Every note hung in the air. Every squeak of the foot pedals. Every plink of my fingers on the keys.</p>
                <p>Then, mid-ballad, what I thought was one of my most impassioned performances of the evening, a couple walked up and asked if I could take their photo.</p>
                <blockquote class="story-quote">Sure. Of course.</blockquote>
                <p>Things settled into a cozy routine after that. I adjusted to the sound of the room. To the quiet.</p>
                <p>And then suddenly, people started walking in from both sides of the bar. Fifty of them. Maybe more.</p>
                <p>The Orient Bar came alive.</p>

                <p>But that's when it hit me. There's a rhythm to certain things on a ship. A coordinated effort between all the elements of life at sea. The dining, the entertainment, the shore excursions, even the sea days. The entire crew works together to achieve that rhythm. And to keep it going through good and bad.</p>

                <blockquote class="story-quote">I was swimming.</blockquote>
                <p>The ship had been transformed in Singapore. Stripped down to the hull and rebuilt into something new.</p>

                        <li><strong>Volcanic Origins:</strong> Banks Peninsula (where Akaroa sits) is formed from two extinct volcanoes. The harbor is actually a flooded volcanic crater.</li>

                <p>They call it "Windy Wellington" and they're not exaggerating. The city sits on the Cook Strait, and the wind funnels through with startling force.</p>
                <p>Locals don't carry umbrellas—they'd just invert. Instead, they lean into it, literally, walking at angles that would look absurd anywhere else.</p>
                <p>But the wind keeps the air clean, the sky clear, and the city invigorated. Wellington earns its energy from the elements.</p>

                <p>Wellington punches above its weight culturally. The coffee scene rivals Melbourne's. Te Papa, the national museum, is genuinely world-class and free.</p>
                <p>And then there's Weta Workshop—where Peter Jackson built Middle-earth. The Lord of the Rings wasn't just filmed here; it was invented here. The creative energy stuck around.</p>
                <p>For a city of 215,000, Wellington has the cultural infrastructure of somewhere much larger.</p>

                <p>The Pacific Pearl had just come out of a month-long refit in Singapore. All crew were onboard as we sailed her out of dry dock - a sweltering month of work with little to no air conditioning and plenty of alcohol for the musicians.</p>
                <p>I was about two years into my contracted life at sea by then. The ship was being transformed from Ocean Village into P&O Australia's newest vessel. New restaurants, new bars, new everything.</p>
                <p>Including a massive chandelier in the atrium.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="story-section-panel">

                <h3 class="section-title-panel">We Watched Them Hang It</h3>
                <p>Me and another crew member watched them install that chandelier. A huge iron and steel structure, several hundred pounds, suspended three stories above the atrium floor.</p>
                <p>They didn't do any load testing. Nothing. They were rushing to get the old girl ready for launch.</p>
                <p>We joked that it wasn't going to last an entire cruise.</p>
                <p>On the maiden voyage out of Sydney, just hours after a massive party in the atrium - all the musicians jamming, passengers running around everywhere, champagne flowing - it fell.</p>
                <p>Three stories. Middle of the night. Crashed into the café area below.</p>
                <p>An hour earlier, we'd all been standing right under it.</p>
                <p>P&O's official statement said "the reassuring thing was that there were no passengers or crew anywhere near the area when it happened." Yeah - because it was 3 AM.</p>

                <p>That was just the beginning.</p>
                <p>A bad storm hit on our first night out of Sydney. Then the captain made an announcement that would have been funny if it wasn't terrifying:</p>
                <p>We had somehow ended up sandwiched between two cyclones.</p>
                <p>The original itinerary - Isle of Pines, maybe Mystery Island - was scrapped. We were making an emergency overnight stop at Port Vila instead.</p>
                <p>The 2010-2011 South Pacific cyclone season was brutal. Cyclone Vania. Cyclone Yasi. Cyclone Atu. We were caught in the middle of all of it.</p>

                <p class="photo-caption-inline">The morning after. That horizontal scratch runs right past deck 5 - right past my cabin.</p>
                <p>The captain put the boat into the dock at Port Vila with enough force that it knocked me off my bed. I was changing my guitar strings at the time.</p>
                <p>When I stood up and got my bearings, I noticed two things:</p>
                <p>First, my floor had buckled upward.</p>
                <p>Second, there was a crack running all the way up my cabin wall. Through that crack, I could see what looked like the hull of the ship.</p>
                <p>For a few days after that, I was famous. The staff captain, head engineer - and it felt like all 700 crew onboard - wanted to peek inside my cabin. After a while I just left my door open for a few days.</p>
                <p>Then I was moved temporarily to a passenger cabin while they made "repairs."</p>
                <p>I never did go back to that cabin. But my good friend Daryl Stevenette did a contract a year later on the Pearl - and the floor was still buckled. The bathroom door didn't quite shut right.</p>
                <p>The staff captain looked at me and said: "You were lucky."</p>
                <p>I could have been crushed by a cruise ship.</p>

                <p>The Pacific Pearl's maiden voyage became legendary for all the wrong reasons:</p>
                <p>• Chandelier falls 3 stories (hours after party underneath)<br>
                • Caught between two cyclones<br>
                • Emergency diversion to Port Vila<br>
                • Hull damage during docking<br>
                • Medical evacuation near Great Barrier Island<br>
                • Non-flushing toilets<br>
                • No drinking water during the storm</p>
                <p>As crew, we were forbidden to talk about most of it. The chandelier incident especially.</p>
                <p>But the ship no longer exists. P&O Australia no longer exists. And this is my story to tell.</p>

                <p>Lifou was one of those places that felt like a secret. A tender port on the regular P&O rotation through the South Pacific - Nouméa, Isle of Pines, Port Vila, and here.</p>
                <p>On the far side of the island was a swimming and snorkeling spot with water so clear it barely looked real. The kind of place you'd see in a travel brochure and assume was photoshopped.</p>
                <p>But it was the church on the hill that kept drawing me back.</p>

                <p>Every time we called at Lifou, I'd make the climb up to this church. It became a ritual. The walk was hot and dusty, but there was something peaceful about that little building at the top of the hill.</p>
                <p>The Pacific run took us through places I'd only seen in documentaries. Turquoise water so clear you could count fish from the tender. Churches older than any building I'd ever entered. Islands where time moved differently.</p>

                <p>One day, walking up to the church, I noticed him. A spider - and not a small one - nestled in a wooden fence that separated someone's property from the road.</p>
                <p>He seemed almost like a pet. Just sitting there in his web, unbothered by the world passing by.</p>
                <p>After that, every time we visited Lifou, I'd look for him as I climbed up to the church. He became my little landmark. A familiar face - all eight eyes of it - on an island far from home.</p>
                <p>And then one visit, he was gone.</p>
                <p>I don't know what happened to him. Maybe he moved on. Maybe something got him. But I still looked for him every time after that, just in case.</p>

                <p>South Georgia is one of those places that exists more as legend than destination. A remote British territory in the South Atlantic, closer to Antarctica than anywhere else. No airport. No permanent population beyond a handful of scientists and museum staff.</p>
                <p>To get here, you cross the Drake Passage - the roughest stretch of ocean on Earth. But when you finally see those jagged peaks rising from the sea, you understand why explorers risked everything to reach this place.</p>

                <p>Before we reached South Georgia, a penguin expert gave a series of talks aboard ship. He was brilliant - the kind of scientist who could make you care deeply about something you'd never thought twice about.</p>
                <p>One evening in the lounge, he showed us a map that tracked the history of commercial whaling. It started in the Northern Atlantic, then moved to the Pacific as those populations collapsed. When there was nothing left up north, the industry pushed south - all the way to these waters.</p>
                <blockquote class="story-quote">They hunted whale populations to near extinction in the north, then chased the survivors to the bottom of the world.</blockquote>
                <p>He hung out with us musicians in the lounge several nights after his talks. He'd request Dan Fogelberg and Cat Stevens songs while we talked about the wildlife we'd see. I wish I'd gotten a photo with him.</p>

                <p>Grytviken was once the largest whaling station in the world. Norwegian whalers built it in 1904, and for sixty years it processed the bodies of hundreds of thousands of whales - blue, fin, humpback, right, sei. Everything.</p>

                <p>The station closed in 1965. In the sixty years since, the wildlife has returned with a vengeance. King penguins waddle through the ruins. Fur seals sprawl on the beaches where whale carcasses were once dragged ashore. Elephant seals sleep in the grass, oblivious to the history beneath them.</p>

                <p>He died here in 1922, at the start of another expedition. His wife asked that he be buried on South Georgia, the island where he'd achieved his greatest triumph. Sailors who visit leave whisky at his grave and toast to "The Boss."</p>

                <p>South Georgia sits at the edge of everything. The edge of the map. The edge of human habitation. The edge of what we're capable of - both the worst and the best.</p>
                <p>We came here to see wildlife, and we saw it in abundance. But we also saw what happens when humans decide something is a resource to be extracted. And we saw what happens when we finally stop.</p>
                <p>The penguins don't know about the history. The seals don't care about the rusted machinery. They've simply moved back in. Maybe that's the only redemption available - not forgiveness, just the patient work of time and nature reclaiming what was taken.</p>

                        <li><strong>Named for Darwin:</strong> The channel was charted by the HMS Beagle in 1833, the same ship that carried Charles Darwin on his famous voyage that would inspire the theory of evolution.</li>
                        <li><strong>Border Dispute:</strong> The channel marks the border between Chile and Argentina. The two nations nearly went to war over islands here in 1978 before the Pope mediated a settlement.</li>
                        <li><strong>Glacier Alley:</strong> The nearby Avenue of the Glaciers features five tidewater glaciers descending from the Darwin Ice Field - named Italia, Holanda, Alemania, Francia, and España.</li>
                        <li><strong>Indigenous History:</strong> The Yaghan people navigated these waters for over 10,000 years, surviving the harsh climate as the world's southernmost human inhabitants.</li>
                        <li><strong>Wildlife:</strong> Magellanic penguins, sea lions, and Andean condors are common sights along the channel's dramatic coastline.</li>

                <p>Sailing up it feels like entering another world. The river is so wide in places you can't see the other side. Pink dolphins surface beside the ship. The jungle presses in from both banks, alive with sounds you've never heard.</p>
                <p>The meeting of the waters nearby - where the black Rio Negro meets the sandy Amazon - they flow side by side without mixing for miles. Like two worlds refusing to blend.</p>

                        <li><strong>Rubber Boom:</strong> In the late 1800s, Manaus was one of the wealthiest cities on Earth. The rubber barons sent their laundry to Europe and built an opera house in the jungle.</li>
                        <li><strong>Teatro Amazonas:</strong> Opened in 1896 with materials imported from Europe - Italian marble, Scottish steel, French tiles. The dome features 36,000 tiles in the colors of the Brazilian flag.</li>
                        <li><strong>Pink Dolphins:</strong> The Amazon river dolphin (boto) is the largest freshwater dolphin species. Local legend says they transform into handsome men at night.</li>

                <p>The Cruise Director had given me the day off - a rare occurrence on an overnight. A walk through town. Looking for something to eat, maybe a drink.</p>

                <p>I found a bar with giant jungle animals painted on the walls. Seemed friendly enough. I sat down and started chatting with the bloke next to me - a "shoe salesman from Croatia," or so he said.</p>
                <p>A few minutes into our conversation, one of the girls from behind the bar got off work - or so she said - and sat down on my other side.</p>
                <p>Just friendly conversation. My radar was up, and I didn't sense anything was off.</p>
                <p>One beer. One shot.</p>
                <p>Then the woman asked if I was alone. Something finally clicked. I waved to a bunch of random people in the corner like I knew them.</p>
                <p>The next thing I remember, I'm stumbling toward the bathroom. Then nothing.</p>

                <p>Then I heard a voice: "Hey - that's Derrick!"</p>
                <p>A hand grabbed me. Pulled my arm over a shoulder. Got me out of there.</p>
                <p>Martin Neely. A fellow musician. A friend. I may have had a few more minutes before I was robbed - or worse - when he walked in and saw me.</p>
                <p>Here's the thing: I had walked around Phuket all day. Downtown, the beaches, everywhere. I hadn't run into a single crew member. Not one. And then, the one moment I really needed someone - there was Martin.</p>

                <p>Pablo Neruda kept three houses in Chile. The one in Valparaíso—La Sebastiana—was his favorite.</p>
                <p>He called this city "a pile of absurd houses." If you've seen how the buildings stack up the hillsides, defying gravity and urban planning, you understand. It was a compliment.</p>
                <p>Neruda loved this place for its chaos, its color, its refusal to be organized. The city still feels that way.</p>

                <p>Some date back to the 1880s. They creak and sway. The views justify the anxiety.</p>
                <p>At the top, every surface is covered in murals. Street art isn't vandalism here; it's civic pride. The whole city is a gallery.</p>
