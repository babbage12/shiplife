                <p>My mom would tell you I was singing before I could talk.</p>
                <p>If you wanted to find me as a kid, all you had to do was listen. If I wasn't banging on a drum set, I was playing clarinet, or guitar, or singing for anyone who would listen. My mom, my grandma, my brother and sister. My great-grandma Gillette would hoist me up onto the doghouse and I would sing the Star Spangled Banner for her, pretending the apples on the trees around us were my audience.</p>
                <p>I made up songs. I sang harmony with the radio. I daydreamed constantly, and it got me into a lot of trouble.</p>
                <p>At age 7, when other kids were playing with Legos, I began playing my dad's Jazzmaster guitar.</p>

                <p>By thirteen, I had my first real band. We called ourselves 5th Avenue, and we played anywhere that would have us - including the Stony Ridge Fair, right in the small town where I grew up.</p>

                <p>When I wasn't lost in music, I'd disappear for hours into the woods, walking the train tracks that ran behind our house, exploring my small world. I imagined I could just keep walking until I'd seen all of it.</p>
                <p>That would have to wait a few years.</p>

                <p>In 1989, I joined a band called Touched. We were hungry, and we were good. Through the early '90s we played high-end nightclubs and hotels to a few very questionable dive bars where I feel I narrowly escaped certain death a few times. The east coast was our circuit - Maine to Florida.</p>

                <h3 class="section-title-panel">Fourteen Years</h3>
                <p>A few years in, the bills started piling up. I needed a steady paycheck, so I got a day job. Customer service. Nothing glamorous, but it paid the rent.</p>
                <p>The thing is - I never stopped playing. I was still gigging with Touched on nights and weekends, still playing around Toledo well into the 2000s. Music never stopped. It just... became the side hustle.</p>
                <p>At first, the day job felt like a reasonable compromise. Stay home, pay the bills, play music when I could. But one year became five. Five became ten. Then I found myself in a credit collections department for an elevator company, screaming at people on the phone for a living.</p>
                <p>After almost fourteen years of punching a clock, I looked around and realized something:</p>
                <blockquote class="story-quote">I was wasting my time.</blockquote>
                <p>The day job wasn't supporting my music career. It was slowly replacing it. And if I didn't do something about it, I'd spend the rest of my life in that cubicle.</p>

                <h3 class="section-title-panel">Visualizing the Escape</h3>
                <p>In 2005, I worked up a few sets of guitar-vocal songs and played my first solo gig in years. It was a good start, but I had a ways to go. If I wanted to escape Toledo and make a living playing music - really make a living - I needed to be prepared.</p>

                <p class="photo-caption-inline">2005. The first solo gig in years. The spark.</p>
                <p>The most important thing I did was to begin to visualize where music could take me again. I started a scrapbook of exotic places and tried to imagine myself playing in grand hotels. Or cruise ships.</p>
                <p>Then one night, late, I started searching for solo guitar gigs. Landed on a British talent website and found an ad that read something like:</p>
                <blockquote class="story-quote">Vocalist/Guitarist wanted for employment opportunity on cruise ship.</blockquote>

                <p>Walking through the first door was the hardest thing I had ever done. I left everything behind. Everything I owned was shoved into a storage space and I left Toledo on July 6th, 2009.</p>

                <p>I had two weeks. Two 7-day cruises. That was the industry standard - the unspoken trial period where the office watched to see if the new soloist would sink or swim. Past that 2-week window was a 14-day cruise to Darwin.</p>
                <p>I knew that if I made it past that window, the home office would turn their attention to more pressing matters. You were left alone to succeed, fail, or burn out at your own pace.</p>
                <p>I heard crew members whispering about the 14-day cruise to Darwin like it was a mystical place. Everyone was excited about an overnight stay. But to me, Darwin represented something else entirely.</p>
                <p>If I could stay on and make it to Darwin without being handed a plane ticket home, I was good for at least my first 4-month contract. And who knows - maybe they would bring me back to do it again.</p>

                <p>On my first day aboard, during orientation, the staff captain told us straight:</p>
                <blockquote class="story-quote">
                    "Ship life will fulfill you, drain you, or wreck you emotionally. You can tell a lot about a person based on how they conduct themselves aboard a ship."
                    <cite>- Staff Captain, Pacific Sun</cite>
                </blockquote>
                <p>I remember sitting there thinking - am I ready for this? Am I ready to become the best version of myself? Because that's what this is going to take.</p>
                <p>Those first weeks were a blur. Learning the sets, the venues, the politics of ship entertainment. Learning the rhythm of a life in motion. You wake up in one country. Perform in another. Sleep somewhere in between.</p>

                <p>They weren't just colleagues. They were professionals, as dedicated to their work as I was to mine. But more than that, we were all witnesses to this strange experience we'd signed on to.</p>
                <p>There was humor and irony in every story told at sea. It just happened that way - so many people from such different places, bumping into each other's unfamiliar ways.</p>

                        <li><strong>WWII Bombing:</strong> Darwin was bombed 64 times during WWII - more than Pearl Harbor. The first attack killed 235 people.</li>
                        <li><strong>Beer Can Regatta:</strong> Every year Darwin hosts a regatta where boats must be made entirely of beer cans. Very Darwin.</li>
                        <li><strong>Closer to Bali:</strong> Darwin is closer to Bali, Indonesia than it is to Sydney. It's Australia's gateway to Asia.</li>
                        <li><strong>Youngest Capital:</strong> With a median age of 34.6, Darwin is Australia's youngest capital city.</li>

                <p>Then the phone rang.</p>
                <p>My agent. P&O wanted me in Singapore in four weeks. Dry dock. A "new" ship called the Pacific Jewel. But there was a catch.</p>
                <p>They didn't want me as a guitarist.</p>
                <p>They wanted me in something called "The Orient Bar."</p>

                <p>I wasn't scheduled to play until the ship started pulling away from Darling Harbour.</p>
                <p>By then it was late. Guests were still in their cabins after their first afternoon on board, still finding their way around. The Orient Bar was on Deck 7, towards the back of the ship. Not everyone would find it right away.</p>

                <p class="photo-caption-inline">The Orient Bar. Elegant. Intimidating. Mostly windows. Mostly empty.</p>
                <p>A few people came in and sat down at first.</p>
                <p>I played. The sound of a baby grand piano in a mostly empty room that was mostly windows — it was jarring. Every note hung in the air. Every squeak of the foot pedals. Every plink of my fingers on the keys.</p>
                <p>Then, mid-ballad — what I thought was one of my most impassioned performances of the evening — a couple walked up and asked if I could take their photo.</p>
                <blockquote class="story-quote">Sure. Of course.</blockquote>
                <p>Things settled into a cozy routine after that. I adjusted to the sound of the room. To the quiet.</p>

                <p class="photo-caption-inline">The bar starting to fill. A few guests finding their way in.</p>
                <p>And then suddenly, people started walking in from both sides of the bar. Fifty of them. Maybe more.</p>

                <p class="photo-caption-inline">My first performance in the Orient Bar.</p>
                <p>For the next four months, I often wished for that quiet piano room again — the one where I could hear each squeak of the pedals, each plink of the keys.</p>
                <p>But that's when it hit me. There's a rhythm to certain things on a ship. A coordinated effort between all the elements of life at sea — the dining, the entertainment, the shore excursions, even the sea days. The entire crew works together to achieve that rhythm. And to keep it going through good and bad.</p>

                <p>The ship had been transformed in Singapore. Stripped down to the hull and rebuilt into something new.</p>
                <p>So had I.</p>

                <p>The Pacific Pearl had just come out of a month-long refit in Singapore. All crew were onboard as we sailed her out of dry dock - a sweltering month of work with little to no air conditioning and plenty of alcohol for the musicians.</p>
                <p>I was about two years into my contracted life at sea by then. The ship was being transformed from Ocean Village into P&O Australia's newest vessel. New restaurants, new bars, new everything.</p>
                <p>Including a massive chandelier in the atrium.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="story-section-panel">
                <span class="section-tag-panel">The Chandelier</span>
                <h3 class="section-title-panel">We Watched Them Hang It</h3>
                <p>Me and another crew member watched them install that chandelier. A huge iron and steel structure, several hundred pounds, suspended three stories above the atrium floor.</p>
                <p>They didn't do any load testing. Nothing. They were rushing to get the old girl ready for launch.</p>
                <p>We joked that it wasn't going to last an entire cruise.</p>
                <p>On the maiden voyage out of Sydney, just hours after a massive party in the atrium - all the musicians jamming, passengers running around everywhere, champagne flowing - it fell.</p>
                <p>Three stories. Middle of the night. Crashed into the café area below.</p>
                <p>An hour earlier, we'd all been standing right under it.</p>
                <p>P&O's official statement said "the reassuring thing was that there were no passengers or crew anywhere near the area when it happened." Yeah - because it was 3 AM.</p>

                <p>That was just the beginning.</p>
                <p>A bad storm hit on our first night out of Sydney. Then the captain made an announcement that would have been funny if it wasn't terrifying:</p>
                <p>We had somehow ended up sandwiched between two cyclones.</p>
                <p>The original itinerary - Isle of Pines, maybe Mystery Island - was scrapped. We were making an emergency overnight stop at Port Vila instead.</p>
                <p>The 2010-2011 South Pacific cyclone season was brutal. Cyclone Vania. Cyclone Yasi. Cyclone Atu. We were caught in the middle of all of it.</p>

                <p class="photo-caption-inline">The morning after. That horizontal scratch runs right past deck 5 - right past my cabin.</p>
                <p>The captain put the boat into the dock at Port Vila with enough force that it knocked me off my bed. I was changing my guitar strings at the time.</p>
                <p>When I stood up and got my bearings, I noticed two things:</p>
                <p>First, my floor had buckled upward.</p>
                <p>Second, there was a crack running all the way up my cabin wall. Through that crack, I could see what looked like the hull of the ship.</p>
                <p>For a few days after that, I was famous. The staff captain, head engineer - and it felt like all 700 crew onboard - wanted to peek inside my cabin. After a while I just left my door open for a few days.</p>
                <p>Then I was moved temporarily to a passenger cabin while they made "repairs."</p>
                <p>I never did go back to that cabin. But my good friend Daryl Stevenette did a contract a year later on the Pearl - and the floor was still buckled. The bathroom door didn't quite shut right.</p>
                <p>The staff captain looked at me and said: "You were lucky."</p>
                <p>I could have been crushed by a cruise ship.</p>

                <p>The Pacific Pearl's maiden voyage became legendary for all the wrong reasons:</p>
                <p>• Chandelier falls 3 stories (hours after party underneath)<br>
                • Caught between two cyclones<br>
                • Emergency diversion to Port Vila<br>
                • Hull damage during docking<br>
                • Medical evacuation near Great Barrier Island<br>
                • Non-flushing toilets<br>
                • No drinking water during the storm</p>
                <p>As crew, we were forbidden to talk about most of it. The chandelier incident especially.</p>
                <p>But the ship no longer exists. P&O Australia no longer exists. And this is my story to tell.</p>

                <p>On the far side of the island was a swimming and snorkeling spot with water so clear it barely looked real. The kind of place you'd see in a travel brochure and assume was photoshopped.</p>

                <p>The Pacific run took us through places I'd only seen in documentaries. Turquoise water so clear you could count fish from the tender. Churches older than any building I'd ever entered. Islands where time moved differently.</p>

                <p>He seemed almost like a pet. Just sitting there in his web, unbothered by the world passing by.</p>
                <p>After that, every time we visited Lifou, I'd look for him as I climbed up to the church. He became my little landmark. A familiar face - all eight eyes of it - on an island far from home.</p>

                <p>I don't know what happened to him. Maybe he moved on. Maybe something got him. But I still looked for him every time after that, just in case.</p>

When one might have been able to take a deep breath of the world around them and be grateful, instead of being pulled in two directions by the beauty and the foreboding evidence of climate change.\n\nI've never been anywhere so consistently uncomfortable temperature-wise.

                <p>South Georgia is one of those places that exists more as legend than destination. A remote British territory in the South Atlantic, closer to Antarctica than anywhere else. No airport. No permanent population beyond a handful of scientists and museum staff.</p>
                <p>To get here, you cross the Drake Passage - the roughest stretch of ocean on Earth. But when you finally see those jagged peaks rising from the sea, you understand why explorers risked everything to reach this place.</p>

                <p>Before we reached South Georgia, a penguin expert gave a series of talks aboard ship. He was brilliant - the kind of scientist who could make you care deeply about something you'd never thought twice about.</p>
                <p>One evening in the lounge, he showed us a map that tracked the history of commercial whaling. It started in the Northern Atlantic, then moved to the Pacific as those populations collapsed. When there was nothing left up north, the industry pushed south - all the way to these waters.</p>
                <blockquote class="story-quote">They hunted whale populations to near extinction in the north, then chased the survivors to the bottom of the world.</blockquote>
                <p>He hung out with us musicians in the lounge several nights after his talks. He'd request Dan Fogelberg and Cat Stevens songs while we talked about the wildlife we'd see. I wish I'd gotten a photo with him.</p>

                <p>South Georgia sits at the edge of everything. The edge of the map. The edge of human habitation. The edge of what we're capable of - both the worst and the best.</p>
                <p>We came here to see wildlife, and we saw it in abundance. But we also saw what happens when humans decide something is a resource to be extracted. And we saw what happens when we finally stop.</p>
                <p>The penguins don't know about the history. The seals don't care about the rusted machinery. They've simply moved back in. Maybe that's the only redemption available - not forgiveness, just the patient work of time and nature reclaiming what was taken.</p>

                        <li><strong>River Volume:</strong> The Amazon discharges more water than the next seven largest rivers combined - about 20% of all freshwater that flows into the world's oceans.</li>
                        <li><strong>Meeting of the Waters:</strong> Near Manaus, the black Rio Negro meets the sandy Rio Solimões. They flow side by side without mixing for over 3 miles due to differences in temperature, speed, and density.</li>
                        <li><strong>Rubber Boom:</strong> In the late 1800s, Manaus was one of the wealthiest cities on Earth. The rubber barons sent their laundry to Europe and built an opera house in the jungle.</li>
                        <li><strong>Teatro Amazonas:</strong> Opened in 1896 with materials imported from Europe - Italian marble, Scottish steel, French tiles. The dome features 36,000 tiles in the colors of the Brazilian flag.</li>
                        <li><strong>Pink Dolphins:</strong> The Amazon river dolphin (boto) is the largest freshwater dolphin species. Local legend says they transform into handsome men at night.</li>

                <p>No cash. No Portuguese. The guy at the register didn't speak English. Someone next to him started translating. I called my bank - they said it wasn't their fault. <em>Yada yada.</em></p>
                <p>Here's the thing: this must happen often at this particular place, because they had a thick metal gate across the doors. To keep people from running.</p>
                <p>After several frantic minutes of explaining, gesturing, phone calls, and what I can only describe as <em>international panic</em>... he punched my number in manually.</p>

                <p>Phuket taught me a lesson I'll never forget.</p>
                <p>The Cruise Director had given me the day off - a rare occurrence on an overnight. A walk through town. Looking for something to eat, maybe a drink.</p>

                <p>I found a bar with giant jungle animals painted on the walls. Seemed friendly enough. I sat down and started chatting with the bloke next to me - a "shoe salesman from Croatia," or so he said.</p>
                <p>A few minutes into our conversation, one of the girls from behind the bar got off work - or so she said - and sat down on my other side.</p>
                <p>Just friendly conversation. My radar was up, and I didn't sense anything was off.</p>
                <p>One beer. One shot.</p>
                <p>Then the woman asked if I was alone. Something finally clicked. I waved to a bunch of random people in the corner like I knew them.</p>
                <p>The next thing I remember, I'm stumbling toward the bathroom. Then nothing.</p>

                <p>I woke up slouched against a urinal. I couldn't stand. I couldn't think straight.</p>
                <p>Then I heard a voice: "Hey - that's Derrick!"</p>
                <p>A hand grabbed me. Pulled my arm over a shoulder. Got me out of there.</p>
                <p>Martin Neely. A fellow musician. A friend. I may have had a few more minutes before I was robbed - or worse - when he walked in and saw me.</p>
                <p>Here's the thing: I had walked around Phuket all day. Downtown, the beaches, everywhere. I hadn't run into a single crew member. Not one. And then, the one moment I really needed someone - there was Martin.</p>
