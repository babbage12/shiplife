            <h3 class="section-title-panel">"You Do Play Piano, Right?"</h3>
            <p>My first contract on the Pacific Sun had ended. I was home for a month. Waiting.</p>
            <p>During my last week at sea, I'd gotten word that P&O wanted me back. But nobody said which ship. Nobody said what I'd be doing.</p>
            <p>Then the phone rang.</p>
            <p>My agent. P&O wanted me in Singapore in four weeks. Dry dock. A "new" ship called the Pacific Jewel. But there was a catch.</p>
            <p>They didn't want me as a guitarist.</p>
            <p>They wanted me in something called "The Orient Bar."</p>
            <p>At the piano.</p>
            <blockquote class="story-quote">"You do play piano, right?"</blockquote>
            <p>Well. Yeah. Kind of.</p>
            <p>I'd worked a piano bar once. Back in 1984. I was 18. Didn't last the summer.</p>
            <p>I play by ear. I knew I could get through all the Billy Joel and Elton John I'd ever need. But was I a <em>pianist</em>?</p>
            <p>Not really.</p>
            <p>Not yet.</p>

            <h3 class="section-title-panel">The Construction Zone</h3>
            <p>I boarded the Pacific Jewel with about a month left of dry dock.</p>
            <p>The ship was not a ship. It was a construction site that happened to float.</p>

            <p>Contractors everywhere. People yelling in languages I didn't recognize. Cafeteria lines a mile long — project managers, welders, electricians, us.</p>
            <p>We ate with them. Partied with them. Sweated through the sticky Singapore heat with them. Tripped over them.</p>

            <p>Every night, I worked in the Orient Bar until late. The place was still a mess. Plastic sheeting. Sawdust. Half-finished fixtures.</p>
            <p>But the piano worked. That's all I needed.</p>

            <p class="photo-caption-inline">The Orient Bar. Under construction. This is where I practiced every night.</p>
            <p>I had over a hundred songs on my list.</p>
            <p>But when I sat down to play? I kept falling back on the same 30.</p>
            <p>That was a problem.</p>
            <p>There were two other pianists in our group. Ashley — our band master. And Alexander — a child prodigy type, pure Liberace energy. Both were incredibly supportive. They had to be.</p>
            <p>I was nervous as hell.</p>

            <p>The first time I saw the finished Orient Bar — the elegant room, the beautiful baby grand, the view out to sea — my fear didn't go away.</p>
            <p>It grew.</p>
            <p>But I was with the Food & Beverage Manager. He was giving me the tour. I couldn't let it show.</p>
            <p>Only my second contract at sea. But I'd already learned the importance of chain of command.</p>
            <p>You don't let them see you sweat.</p>

            <p>The Jewel wasn't doing the short runs like the Sun.</p>
            <p>These were longer cruises. Sometimes 18 days at sea.</p>
            <p>And this wasn't just any cruise.</p>
            <p>This was the <em>inaugural</em> voyage.</p>
            <p>There would be dignitaries on board.</p>

            <p>I wasn't scheduled to play until the ship started pulling away from Darling Harbour.</p>
            <p>By then it was late. Guests were still in their cabins after their first afternoon on board, still finding their way around. The Orient Bar was on Deck 7, towards the back of the ship. Not everyone would find it right away.</p>

            <p>A few people came in and sat down at first.</p>
            <p>I played. The sound of a baby grand piano in a mostly empty room that was mostly windows — it was jarring. Every note hung in the air. Every squeak of the foot pedals. Every plink of my fingers on the keys.</p>
            <p>Then, mid-ballad — what I thought was one of my most impassioned performances of the evening — a couple walked up and asked if I could take their photo.</p>
            <blockquote class="story-quote">Sure. Of course.</blockquote>
            <p>Things settled into a cozy routine after that. I adjusted to the sound of the room. To the quiet.</p>

            <p>But that's when it hit me. There's a rhythm to certain things on a ship. A coordinated effort between all the elements of life at sea — the dining, the entertainment, the shore excursions, even the sea days. The entire crew works together to achieve that rhythm. And to keep it going through good and bad.</p>
