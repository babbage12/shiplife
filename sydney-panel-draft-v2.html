            <h3 class="section-title-panel">"You Do Play Piano, Right?"</h3>
            <p>My first contract on the Pacific Sun had ended. I was home for a month. Waiting.</p>
            <p>During my last week at sea, I'd gotten word that P&O wanted me back. But nobody said which ship. Nobody said what I'd be doing.</p>
            <p>Then the phone rang.</p>
            <p>My agent. P&O wanted me in Singapore in four weeks. Dry dock. A "new" ship called the Pacific Jewel. But there was a catch.</p>
            <p>They didn't want me as a guitarist.</p>
            <p>They wanted me in something called "The Orient Bar."</p>
            <p>At the piano.</p>
            <blockquote class="story-quote">"You do play piano, right?"</blockquote>
            <p>Well. Yeah. Kind of.</p>
            <p>I'd worked a piano bar once. Back in 1984. I was 18. Didn't last the summer.</p>
            <p>I play by ear. I knew I could get through all the Billy Joel and Elton John I'd ever need. But was I a <em>pianist</em>?</p>
            <p>Not really.</p>
            <p>Not yet.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="story-section-panel">
            <span class="section-tag-panel">Singapore</span>
            <h3 class="section-title-panel">The Construction Zone</h3>
            <p>I boarded the Pacific Jewel with about a month left of dry dock.</p>
            <p>The ship was not a ship. It was a construction site that happened to float.</p>
            <img src="[CLOUDINARY_URL_DRYDOCK]" class="story-image" data-caption="Pacific Jewel in dry dock, Singapore." alt="Pacific Jewel in dry dock">
            <p class="photo-caption-inline">Pacific Jewel in dry dock. Workers on bicycles. Scaffolding everywhere. This was home now.</p>
            <p>Contractors everywhere. People yelling in languages I didn't recognize. Cafeteria lines a mile long — project managers, welders, electricians, us.</p>
            <p>We ate with them. Partied with them. Sweated through the sticky Singapore heat with them. Tripped over them.</p>
            <p>The musicians got close fast. We had chores during the day — nothing too bad — but we escaped whenever we could. I got to know the Singapore MRT. I got to know the malls.</p>
            <blockquote class="story-quote">Malls meant two things: food and wifi.</blockquote>
            <p>Air conditioning. A food court. A connection to home.</p>
            <p>That was the escape. But underneath it all — underneath the exploring and the jokes and the long walks through the city — there was worry.</p>
            <p>I wasn't ready.</p>

            <h3 class="section-title-panel">Pounding the Keys</h3>
            <p>Every night, I worked in the Orient Bar until late. The place was still a mess. Plastic sheeting. Sawdust. Half-finished fixtures.</p>
            <p>But the piano worked. That's all I needed.</p>
            <img src="[CLOUDINARY_URL_ORIENT_BAR]" class="story-image" data-caption="The Orient Bar." alt="The Orient Bar">
            <p class="photo-caption-inline">The Orient Bar. Elegant. Intimidating. The room that terrified me.</p>
            <p>I had over a hundred songs on my list.</p>
            <p>But when I sat down to play? I kept falling back on the same 30.</p>
            <p>That was a problem.</p>
            <p>There were two other pianists in our group. Ashley — our band master. And Alexander — a child prodigy type, pure Liberace energy. Both were incredibly supportive. They had to be.</p>
            <p>I was nervous as hell.</p>
            <p>The first time I saw the finished Orient Bar — the elegant room, the beautiful baby grand, the view out to sea — my fear didn't go away.</p>
            <p>It grew.</p>
            <p>But I was with the Food & Beverage Manager. He was giving me the tour. I couldn't let it show.</p>
            <p>Only my second contract at sea. But I'd already learned the importance of chain of command.</p>
            <p>You don't let them see you sweat.</p>

            <p>The Jewel wasn't doing the short runs like the Sun.</p>
            <p>These were longer cruises. Sometimes 18 days at sea.</p>
            <p>And this wasn't just any cruise.</p>
            <p>This was the <em>inaugural</em> voyage.</p>
            <p>There would be dignitaries on board.</p>
            <p>VIPs.</p>
            <p>The Governor.</p>
            <blockquote class="story-quote">Oh holy shit.</blockquote>
            <p>Yeah.</p>
            <p>I was nervous.</p>
            <p>Would you be?</p>

            <p class="photo-caption-inline">I felt like a movie star. I was terrified.</p>
            <p>That's me. Standing in front of the Pacific Jewel. Opera House in the background. Black suit. Big smile.</p>
            <p>The smile was real. So was the terror underneath it.</p>
            <p>That night: the inaugural party. Pink Hummer limos pulling up. Crowds everywhere. A stage on the dock. Fireworks planned for midnight.</p>

            <p>We pulled away from the dock.</p>
            <p>The Opera House slid past. Lit up. Glowing against the dark.</p>

            <p>The pianist I was about to become?</p>
            <p>He sailed out into the dark.</p>

            <p>I don't remember the first night at that piano.</p>
            <p>I've blocked most of it out.</p>
            <p>But I remember the second night. The third. And somewhere around the fifth or sixth night, sitting at that baby grand in the Orient Bar, I realized something.</p>
            <blockquote class="story-quote">I wasn't drowning.</blockquote>
            <blockquote class="story-quote">I was swimming.</blockquote>
            <p>The ship had been transformed in Singapore. Stripped down to the hull and rebuilt into something new.</p>
            <p>So had I.</p>
