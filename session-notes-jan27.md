## "I'm Gonna Sail" Lyrics Reconstruction

Attempted to find original lyrics from ~2012 copyright registration. Could not locate in US Copyright Office records - may never have been registered.

Reconstructed from memory with some new lines written:

**VERSE 1:**
> I got a few dollars in my pocket from my 401k
> It's true what they say, can't take it with you anyway
> My inbox is stacked like a mountain in Peru
> It really got me thinking, I've got better things to do

**PRE-CHORUS:**
> I'm going to head out of the city to the Florida Keys
> I've got my guitar strapped across my back to keep me company
> I'm going to hop on to a boat and sail to Mexico
> [line 4 - still working on this]

**CHORUS:**
> I'm gonna sail... I'm gonna sail...
> Forget the bills, the job, the house, the phone and the mail
> My cubicle tried to kill me but deep inside I knew
> I'll never feel that kind of pressure when I'm on top of all that blue
> ...water... I'm gonna sail... blue water...

**VERSE 2:** (new - written today)
> Off Milford Sound NZ on a 23 day cruise
> A horn echoes off the fiords and I reach for my snooze
> As my eyes begin to open on this dream that came true
> I won't be late for work as I'm on top of all that blue

**Still needed:**
- Pre-chorus line 4
- Possibly more verse 2 lines (trade-off humor, "told you so" ending)
